# Icon

A short explanation of how to build the icon from its source files.

> [!NOTE]
> You must first follow the instructions in
> [Installation](../DOCUMENTATION.md#Installation).

Step 1: `cd icon`

Step 2: `./make_icon`

> This is a `bash` script that runs `svg_path_turtle` on the 
> turtle files. Then it runs the compositor to create `out.svg`

Step 3: Open `out.svg` in your web browser.

That should do it!
